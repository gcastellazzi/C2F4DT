```

## Plugins
- **Cloud2FEM** is included as a plugin that transforms point clouds into finite element meshes.
- Additional plugins can extend the viewer with new features (e.g., clustering, import/export, custom visualization).
- External **extensions** can be distributed in separate repositories and integrated at runtime.

## Conventions
- **Docstrings**: Follow **Google** or **NumPy** style for clarity.
- **Naming**: Use clear names for Qt signals/slots, viewer methods, and plugin entry points.
- **Tests**: Add lightweight tests where feasible; include both unit and integration tests.
- **Style**: Follow **PEP8** guidelines for Python code formatting.
- **Typing**: Use type hints consistently for function signatures.
- **Logging**: Employ Pythonâ€™s `logging` module for runtime information and debugging.
- **Separation of concerns**: Maintain modularity by separating UI, core viewer, plugins, and data handling.
- **Testing strategy**: Place tests alongside modules or in a dedicated `tests/` directory; ensure plugin APIs are tested as well.
