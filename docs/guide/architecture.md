## Conventions
- Docstrings: **Google** or **NumPy** style
- Clear names for Qt signals/slots and viewer methods
- Add lightweight tests where feasible
- Code style: Follow **PEP8** guidelines for Python code formatting
- Typing: Use type hints consistently for function signatures
- Logging: Employ Pythonâ€™s logging module for runtime information and debugging
- Separation of concerns: Maintain modularity by separating UI, logic, and data handling
- Testing strategy: Write unit and integration tests; place tests alongside modules or in a dedicated `tests/` directory
